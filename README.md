# Real-Time Scoring and Leaderboard System

This project is a scalable **real-time scoring and leaderboard system** built using **ASP.NET Core** with **.NET 8**, **Entity Framework Core**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis**. It allows players to submit match results, update scores, and retrieve leaderboard rankings efficiently, even under heavy traffic. The system is designed to handle high volumes of concurrent requests, maintain data consistency, and prevent data loss.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Scoring**: Players can submit match results, and their scores are updated and reflected on the leaderboard immediately.
- **Leaderboard Ranking**: The leaderboard ranks players based on their score, experience, and trophy count. Players with the same score are ranked by additional criteria such as experience level and time of achievement.
- **Redis Caching**: Frequently accessed data, such as the top 100 players, is cached in Redis for fast retrieval, reducing database load during high traffic.
- **PostgreSQL for Data Persistence**: Player scores and leaderboard data are persisted in PostgreSQL to ensure data integrity and prevent data loss.
- **Transaction Management**: All critical operations, such as score updates and leaderboard changes, are wrapped in transactions to ensure atomicity and consistency.
- **Error Handling & Data Consistency**: The system uses retry mechanisms and transaction rollbacks to prevent data loss in case of network issues or database failures.
- **Scalability**: The system can scale horizontally to handle large volumes of traffic, with caching and optimized database queries for performance.
- **Security**: Secure API endpoints with JWT authentication, password hashing, and input validation to prevent score manipulation or unauthorized access.

## Tech Stack

- **ASP.NET Core** (.NET 8)
- **Entity Framework Core** (for data access)
- **PostgreSQL** (as the primary data store)
- **Redis** (for caching leaderboard data)
- **Microsoft Identity** (for securing API calls)
- **Docker** (for containerization and easy deployment)

## Future Enhancements

- Implementing more sophisticated ranking algorithms based on customizable criteria.
- Adding pagination support to leaderboard retrieval.
- Real-time WebSocket updates for leaderboard changes.
